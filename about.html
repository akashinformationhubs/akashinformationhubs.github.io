			    <p>I would like to thank all you, for taking your time to get to know us and also using our sources to solve the problems that you have faced to familiarize with the new procedures you come across when you visit the United States for the first time.</p>
		    	<p>I started this website because I have faced some problems whenever I try to apply for the any basic forms of identification like a driverâ€™s license or a state ID. I tried to find some sources online but could not find one easily; I had to go through at least three to four sources to get access to the proper information and I hated that, when I spoke with my friends; even they have faced similar problems when they were new to this country.</p> 
				  <p>So, I made this website has I did not want others to face similar problem, that me and my friends have faced. I made the procedure look as simple as it can get, so everyone can understand it and get their works done quickly.</p> 
				  <p>Over the time I will be adding any updates to the procedure and add more of these kinds of procedures to the website.</p><br>
